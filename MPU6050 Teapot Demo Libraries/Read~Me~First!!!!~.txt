READ THESE GUIDES FIRST ^^^^^^^^^^


Quick Guide (for experienced users)
1) Move each zip into corressponding arduino/processing folder.
2) ( i2C DevLibMaster.zip HAS MANY SUBCATEGORIES!! !~FIND MPU 6050 FOLDER~!
!~FIND MPU 6050 FOLDER~! COPY THIS FOLDER TO ARDUINO/Libraries)
3) ( postspectacular-toxiclibs-44d9932dbc9f (1).zip 
goes to processing2.2.1/sketchbook/libraries/toxiclibs)
3.5) IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THIS FOLDER. OPEN PROCESSING, GO
TO PREFERENCES, CHANGE THE DEFAULT FOLDER TO 'processing2.2.1'
THEN PRESS OK. THIS WILL CREATE 'sketchbook' INSIDE THE PROCESSING ROOT
FOLDER. NOW GO HERE AND CREATE A FOLDER CALLED 'libraries'
4) You should now go see these subfolders in the Arduino & Processing
drop down menu! (& File/Example MPU6050 Will Be there)

Thanks to @PlyAlex (Youtube Channel) for providing the working links above!
